# eCommerce-Business-Performance-Analysis-with-SQL

In a fast-track eCommerce Business nowadays, it is crucial to track, monitor and judge the business performance of every business process in the company. In this project, the main focus will be the analysis of the business performance metrics such as customer growth, product quality, and payment type.

The initial step is to import the datasets into an RDBMS (In this project, PGAdmin4 is used - using PostgreSQL query language). Based on the analysis, it can be seen that the customer base are growing rapidly over the past 3 years. However, aligning with customer growth, problems such as complaints handling and customer retention management are emerging as well. The quality of the products sold is also very important in the management of the business. As for the payment type, the analysis can prove to be useful by establishing a good partnership with the most popular payment type.
